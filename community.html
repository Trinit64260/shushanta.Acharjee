    <h1>Golap-Bandhan Student Association (Feb 2012 - Mar 2014)</h1>
    <h2>Founding President</h2>
    <p>At the heart of Shahjalal University of Science and Technology in Sylhet, Bangladesh, we established a beacon for student welfare. Focused on supporting newly admitted bachelor students from marginalized communities, we assist with accommodations, part-time job placements, and a myriad of other tailored needs. Beyond academic support, we rally during national crises, notably providing aid to flood victims.</p>
