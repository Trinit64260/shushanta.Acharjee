        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate specializing in Entrepreneurship and Management at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and am actively exploring job opportunities.</p>
        <p>My research primarily delves into the realm of social entrepreneurship. I investigate factors influencing social entrepreneurship, the legitimacy of social enterprises in developing contexts, their internationalization strategies, and the cultural barriers they encounter.</p>
        <p>Professionally, I serve as a Lecturer at the ESIC Business and Marketing School in Barcelona and hold an adjunct position at Pompeu Fabra University. Before embarking on my doctoral journey, I earned a BSS in Sociology from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology and an MSc in Applied Research in Economics and Business.</p>
        <p>On a personal note, I'm an avid football enthusiast with allegiance to the Barcelona Football Club. My interest in sports doesn't end thereâ€”I keep tabs on events in Cricket, Tennis, and more. Apart from sports, I keenly follow global politics and have a diverse musical palate, ranging from pop and hip-hop to R&amp;B and classical. Traveling enriches my experiences, and I seize every opportunity to explore new horizons.</p>
